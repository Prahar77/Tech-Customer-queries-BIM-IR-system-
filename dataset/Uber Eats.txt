@UberEats - Wrong Order Received

@UberEats, I just received my food order, and it’s completely wrong! 😡 I ordered a burger, but I got a salad instead. I’ve already submitted a request for a refund, but I was really looking forward to my meal. Is there anything else you can do to fix this faster?
