@NetflixHelps - Streaming Issues

Many Netflix users have been facing streaming issues since the recent app update. Some users on Android devices are experiencing buffering even with strong internet connections, while others report that video quality drops suddenly. Reinstalling the app doesn't seem to fix the problem, and the issues persist across different devices. Netflix's support team has been responding with the usual advice, like clearing cache or checking internet speed, but the solution isnâ€™t consistent.

Others have complained that the app crashes entirely when casting to devices like Chromecast or Fire Stick. While Netflix's social media support remains active, a few users have expressed frustration over the lack of a permanent fix. Many users are hoping that the next app update will resolve the problems. For now, checking the Netflix support page for potential updates seems to be the best option.
