@GooglePhotos - Storage Limit Reached

Hey @GooglePhotos, I just got a notification that Iâ€™ve reached my storage limit. ðŸ˜• I have tons of old photos that I donâ€™t need, but I canâ€™t seem to find the option to delete them all at once. Is there an easy way to free up space without going through each photo individually?
