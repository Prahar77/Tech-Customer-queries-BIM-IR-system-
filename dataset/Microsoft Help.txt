@MicrosoftHelps - Windows 11 Issues

After the latest Windows 11 update, users are experiencing a variety of problems. Some have noted that their systems freeze unexpectedly, while others are reporting compatibility issues with older applications. The new update has also caused Wi-Fi connectivity issues for some, where the connection keeps dropping intermittently.

Microsoft's customer service team has suggested rolling back to a previous update or performing a clean installation of Windows, but these solutions are not ideal for all users. Thereâ€™s growing frustration, particularly among those who rely on their PCs for work. Microsoft has yet to provide an official statement addressing these widespread issues, though many expect a patch in the coming weeks.
