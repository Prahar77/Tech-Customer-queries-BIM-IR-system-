@FitbitSupport - Syncing Problem

@FitbitSupport, my Fitbit hasnâ€™t been syncing with the app for the past few days. âŒš Iâ€™ve tried restarting the device and reconnecting Bluetooth, but it still wonâ€™t update my steps or sleep data. Is there a new update that I missed, or should I try something else?
