@AmazonHelp - Delivery Delays

Amazon Prime members are reporting significant delays in deliveries. Many customers, who are used to the guaranteed two-day shipping, have noticed that their packages are arriving late, with some being delayed for over a week. The issue seems to affect various regions and is not limited to specific products.

Some users have reached out to Amazon via social media, expressing concerns about the lack of real-time updates for their deliveries. While Amazonâ€™s customer service team is responsive, offering refunds or free months of Prime membership, the root cause of the delay remains unclear. With the upcoming holiday season, many are worried that this issue will worsen, leading to missed gifts and frustrated customers.
