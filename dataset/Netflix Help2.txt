@NetflixHelp - Buffering Issues

Hey @NetflixHelp! 🍿 I’ve been having some serious buffering problems lately, and it's ruining my binge-watching sessions! Every time I try to stream a movie or show, it gets stuck loading at 25%, and when it does start, the quality is terrible. 😩 I’ve already tried restarting my router and even reinstalling the app on my smart TV, but nothing seems to help.

I’m on a 100 Mbps connection, so speed shouldn’t be the issue. Is there something wrong with the servers or should I try adjusting my settings? I’ve seen others on Reddit complaining about the same thing, so it’s definitely not just me. A fix would be awesome!
