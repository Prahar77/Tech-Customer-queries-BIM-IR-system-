@PlayStationSupport - Controller Drift

@PlayStationSupport Iâ€™m experiencing some serious controller drift on my DualSense ðŸ˜•. Whenever I play any game, my character moves on its own, especially to the left. Iâ€™ve tried recalibrating it, but it doesnâ€™t seem to fix the issue. Itâ€™s starting to get super annoying, especially when Iâ€™m playing competitive games like FIFA and Call of Duty. ðŸŽ®

Iâ€™ve heard some people talking about this being a hardware issue with the thumbstick, but I donâ€™t want to buy a new controller just yet. Can you recommend a workaround or solution?
