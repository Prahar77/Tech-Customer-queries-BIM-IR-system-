@YouTubeHelp - Video Not Playing in HD

@YouTubeHelp, Iâ€™m having trouble getting videos to play in HD. ðŸŽ¥ No matter what I do, they keep defaulting to 480p even though my internet is fast enough for higher quality. Iâ€™ve tried adjusting the settings, but itâ€™s not working. Any ideas on how to fix this?
