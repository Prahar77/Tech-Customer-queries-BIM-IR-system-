@TeslaSupport - Charging Station Error

@TeslaSupport, Iâ€™m having trouble with one of the Superchargers in my area. âš¡ Every time I try to plug in, I get an error message saying the station is unavailable, even though there are open spots. Iâ€™ve tried different stations, and it works fine, but this one is always a problem. Can you look into it?
