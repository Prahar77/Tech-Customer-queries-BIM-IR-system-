@AppleSupport - AirPods Connection Issue

Hey @AppleSupport, Iâ€™ve been having trouble connecting my AirPods to my iPhone. ðŸŽ§ Sometimes they connect, but other times they just donâ€™t show up in the Bluetooth menu. Iâ€™ve reset them a few times, but the problem keeps coming back. What should I do?
