@SamsungSupport - Smart TV Issues

@SamsungSupport, Iâ€™m having a weird issue with my Smart TV. Whenever I switch between apps like YouTube and Netflix, the screen just goes black, and I have to restart the TV to get it working again. Itâ€™s been happening a lot lately, and Iâ€™ve already updated the firmware. Any advice? ðŸ¤”
