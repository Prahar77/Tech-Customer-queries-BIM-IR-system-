@Uber_Support - Ride Cancellation Confusion

@Uber_Support, whatâ€™s going on with all these cancellations? ðŸ¤” Iâ€™ve had three drivers cancel my ride in the last hour, and now Iâ€™m stuck waiting for another one! Every time a driver is close by, they suddenly cancel, and Iâ€™m left without any ride and still get charged a cancellation fee. ðŸ˜¡ Not cool.

Iâ€™ve already contacted customer support, but they keep telling me itâ€™s a driver issue. Is there any way to improve the matching system? Iâ€™m trying to get to an appointment, and this is super frustrating.
