@SpotifyCares - Playlist Shuffle Problem

Hey @SpotifyCares, I think thereâ€™s something wrong with the shuffle feature on my playlists. ðŸŽ¶ It keeps playing the same 10 songs over and over again, even though my playlist has over 100 songs. Iâ€™ve tried restarting the app and reinstalling it, but no luck. Can you help me fix this? ðŸ˜•
