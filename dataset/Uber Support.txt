@Uber_Support - Driver Cancellations

Uber riders have been experiencing a surge in driver cancellations, with many reporting that drivers cancel at the last minute, leaving them stranded. This issue is particularly noticeable during peak hours or in busy cities, where drivers accept a ride, only to cancel moments later if they find a more convenient fare.

Uber’s support team has been advising customers to report these incidents through the app, but there’s frustration over the lack of immediate compensation or ride alternatives. Many users feel that the company needs to implement stricter policies to prevent drivers from canceling rides without consequences.
